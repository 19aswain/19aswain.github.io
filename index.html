              <p>
                I have previously studied the Edexcel GCSE Computer Science
                course, where I used software such as IDLE and VSCode to improve
                my coding expertise. As a result I am able to code in <strong>python</strong> on
                both software as well as using physical components such as 
                <strong>BBC Microbits</strong> which has allowed me to grasp a more
                extensive knowledge of the language. As a result of my studies in 
                python I am also been able to learn to code in languages such as 
                <strong>C++, HTML and CSS.</strong> I have also been a member of a 
                <strong>Vex Robotics</strong> team which has allowed me to be able to
                work more effectively in a team as well as grasp a greater understanding of robotics.

                Throughout my time studying at the Simon Langton Grammar School
                for Boys I am studying <strong>Computer Science, Physics, Maths,
                 and Design</strong> as A-Level subjects and have previously studied
                <strong> English Literature, English Language, Biology, Chemistry,and Mandarin</strong>
                 for GCSE. By learning all these subjects it has allowed me to be able
                 to use knowledge from other fields, improving my ability in computer science
                 such as using mathematical thinking and ordering to improve my coding
                 and my design skills to assist in my styling of the website.

                Currently I am a member of the product engineering project where 
                we work in conjunction with BAE to create a design. The brief is 
                to create an <strong>"Instant Low Altitude Situation Reporter"</strong> and as a 
                group we have agreed to create a UAV Drone hybrid that can be used
                in situations such as search and rescue. For this project my main 
                role is to act as the programmer, making sure that the drone is both
                easy to control while also being robust and functional in it's uses.
